                        <dd> It's Feeding Time <br>Have you ever wanted to feed a cow? Of course you have. But here's the problem: the cow is hungry. And you've dropped the food. Collect the food you dropped and drop it in the cow's bowl before time runs out! </dd>

                            <h3>Moving Cow</h3><br> The cow will act as a barrier to avoid. If the farmer hits the cow, his health will go down according to the cow's stats.<br>
                        </dd>
                        <dd>
                            <h3>Collect Food</h3><br> The food will be hidden throughout the farm area. The farmer will have to pick it up and avoid the cow before returning it to the cow's feeding troff.The more the cow can eat, the fatter he gets and the slower he gets. The slower he gets, the less likely he is to reach the farmer. Different food has different potencies. They will affect the cow differently. <br>

                            <h3>Starting Off</h3><br> Players will be thrown into the games with no instructions other than "MOOOOVE OVER FOR THE COW!" Yes, this is confusing, but what about this isn't confusing? I too am confused! </dd>

                        <dd>Hi! My name is Kimmy. I like Stardew Valley and Untitled Goose :D. I do a lot of things and I really, really love
                            <a href="https://squishmallows.com">Squishmallows.</a> . I am a Gamification Programmer for a <a href=" www.fruitfulhealth.org"> startup out of LA</a> and a brand new <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/bciresearchrit/home">Researcher for NXT</a>(I deal with the ugly physics engine stuff). I also do a lot of work for Unity Technologies including being a Unity Student Ambassador. I've been working in serious games since 2015 and you can see some stuff I've worked on at some different Universities and a few companies. That's enough of all that listing. It's a lot of boring stuff that has nothing to do with cows. <br> I also do a lot of hackathons. My favorite hackathon project has either been a pancake robot that prints pancakes based on an image or Project Focus which uses machine learning to do some fun things with brain waves. You can usually find me in the SSE, WIC space, CODERIT meetings, IGM labs, or at Target buying more Squishmallows. Come see me during my labbie hours in the big IGM lab!
